USER GUIDE: CIS256 DOCUMENT SEARCH ENGINE
================================================================================

1. SETUP REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
Before running the search engine, you must ensure the following:

   A. 'documents' Folder
      - Your project directory must contain a folder named "documents".
      - Inside this folder, place the .txt files you want to search (e.g., doc1.txt, doc2.txt).
      - If this folder is missing or empty, the indexer will have nothing to search.

   B. Compilation
      - Ensure all Java files in 'src/main/java/csm/cis256' are compiled.
      - If using an IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse), simply run the 'Main' class.
      - If using the command line, compile all files and run 'csm.cis256.Main'.

2. HOW TO RUN
-------------
   Run the main class: csm.cis256.Main

   On startup, the system will:
   1. Print "Indexing 'documents' folder..."
   2. Read all text files in that directory.
   3. Build the Inverted Index in memory.
   4. Display the command prompt ">>".

3. SEARCHING
------------
   To search for documents, simply type your search terms at the prompt.

   * Single Word Search:
     >> apple
     (Returns a ranked list of documents containing "apple")

   * Multi-Word Search (AND Search):
     >> quick fox
     (Returns documents that contain BOTH "quick" AND "fox", ranked by combined frequency)

4. NAVIGATION & COMMANDS
------------------------
   The search engine supports a "browser-like" history. You can view documents
   and navigate back and forward through your viewing history.

   * View a Document:
     >> :view doc1.txt
     (Simulates opening "doc1.txt". This adds the document to your history stack.)

   * Go Back:
     >> :back
     (Returns to the previously viewed document.)

   * Go Forward:
     >> :forward
     (Returns to the document you were on before clicking back.)

   * Check History:
     >> :history
     (Displays the current document you are viewing.)

   * Quit:
     >> :quit
     (Exits the program.)

5. EXAMPLE SESSION
------------------
   >> quick
      Found in documents (Ranked):
      1. doc1.txt
      2. doc2.txt

      Now viewing: doc1.txt

   >> :view doc3.txt
      Now viewing: doc3.txt

   >> :back
      Went back to: doc1.txt

   >> :forward
